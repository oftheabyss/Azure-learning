# Azure Learning
## Overview
This project contains various templates for deploying various resources within an Azure tenant. Some things I learned while building out [Azure Landing Zones](https://github.com/johnsblevins/AzureLandingZones) across multiple tenants in both Azure Government and Azure Commercial clouds, others are from simply trying to learn the platform.
